## The Dev Zone
### Before You Start
Run in the terminal:  
```
yarn install  
yarn start
```

The web app will open in your default browser.  

### Implementation
* **Framework** -  React for its ease of use, vast community and reusable components methodology.
* **State Management** - We use MobX State Tree to manage state. The opinionated methodology makes it easy for us to work together and makes the code readable.
* **Routing** - Reach router is one of the easiest solutions we could find.
* **UI** - We chose to go with Material UI for its simplicity and many available examples.
